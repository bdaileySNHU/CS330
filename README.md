Computer Graphics and Visualization

When approaching this project, I took a iterative approach. This was guided by the milestones that were given for the course. Breaking the project down into smaller pieces really helped tackle a large project like this. Rendering the basic shapes was the first step. Then I added textures and lighting. I feel like this course taught me a lot about debugging by changing one thing at a time and seeing how it affected the scene. I feel like most software development these days has some kind og visual element to it. Learning how to create visuals in a 3  dimensional space will be very useful.
